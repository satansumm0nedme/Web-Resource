                        Stephen King first started his writing career in 1959 by publishing his own local newspaper with a friend titled "Dave's Rags". Soon his first novel Carrie would be published in 1974 by Doubleday. What is largely considered "Classic" King, including the development of his alias as Richard Bachman. King was heavily drinking and drugging throughout this time period. In his essay On Writing, he admits that he doesn't remember writing Cujo due to being heavily intoxicated at the time. This is when King was considered the "King of Horror" due to his works being  adapted into successful movies and TV shows, including classics like The Shining and Carrie. These adaptations have helped to bring his stories to a broader audience and have contributed to the popularity of the horror genre in mainstream media.</p>

While his earlier works often showcased a raw intensity and frenetic energy fueled by personal struggles, his post-recovery writing displayed a more refined narrative style, with a focus on character development and psychological depth. King's sober years brought forth a richer exploration of human emotions and themes, adding layers of complexity to his storytelling while maintaining the signature elements of suspense and horror that made him a literary icon.
